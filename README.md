# AD9833_library
control library ad9833 with stm32
tested on stm32h7 in STM32CubeIDE environment
The NSS pin will be pulled up to the power supply, through a 10 kÎ© resistor

SYSCLK 480MHz

Setting SPI 
mode transmit only master;
hardware nss signal hardware NSS output signal;
data size 16 bit;
msb first;
prescaler 128;
CPOL High;
CPHA 2 Edge;
NSS sygnal type output hardware;
NSS polarity NSS polarity low;

connection
STM32    to     AD9833
SPI_MOSI ->   SDATA;
SPI_SCK  ->   SCLK;
SPI_NSS  ->   FSYNC;

I took the synchronization for the oscillator from an external 10 MHz oscillator, the output was controlled by an oscilloscope.

example: 
uint32_t freq = 1000;
AD9833reset();
AD9833_SetWave(SIN);
AD9833setFrequency(freq);
